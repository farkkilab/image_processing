# White Top-Hat Filtering for Microscopy Image Preprocessing

## Why Filtering Matters
Microscopy images often suffer from **uneven background illumination**, **autofluorescence**, or **haze**.  
These artifacts can obscure small, biologically meaningful structures (e.g., puncta, foci, granules) and make downstream quantification unreliable.

## Why It Is Important
1. **Removes Illumination Gradients**  
   Corrects uneven lighting across the field of view.
2. **Enhances Small Bright Features**  
   Structures such as nuclear foci, vesicles, or small puncta become more distinguishable.
3. **Improves Quantification Robustness**  
   Measurements of intensity per cell are less biased by background variations.

## What Is White Top-Hat Filtering?
White top-hat is defined as:
